## Design Patterns in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in Java, including the Observer, Strategy, and Decorator patterns. Each pattern is explained with definitions, key components, UML diagrams, and example code.

## Design Patterns

### Observer Design Pattern
Refer to [`notes/observer-pattern.md`](notes/observer-pattern.md) for detailed example code.

### Strategy Design Pattern
Refer to [`notes/strategy-pattern.md`](notes/strategy-pattern.md) for detailed example code.

### Decorator Design Pattern
Refer to [`notes/decorator-pattern.md`](notes/decorator-pattern.md) for detailed example code.

## SOLID Principles
This project also includes notes on SOLID principles, which are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Refer to [`notes/SOLID Principle.md`](notes/SOLID%20Principle.md) for detailed explanations and examples.
